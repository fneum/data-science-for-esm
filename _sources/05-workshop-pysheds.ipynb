The result of this calculation is a grid where each cell's value represents the count of all cells that flow into it, directly or indirectly. In essence, it gives you an idea of the potential water volume that would pass through each point if each cell contributed a unit amount of water. The flow accumulation process takes the flow direction grid as input and works by tracking the flow from each cell to its downslope neighbors. It aggregates the number of cells flowing into each downslope cell, essentially \"accumulating\" the flow as it moves through the drainage network. Hence, as you move downstream, the number increases, and the other way around for upstream. \n"

This type of holistic assessment takes the regional and downstream effects of the entire hydropower scenario into account and allows for strategic planning by comparing various national or international development options.

By integrating surface runoff data over the entire catchment area, typically given in volume per area per time (e.g. millimetres per day), and summing it up for all the cells within the catchment, you can approximate the total water volume contributing to the flow at the pour point. This integration accounts for spatial variations in runoff generation across the catchment, providing you with an aggregated flow estimate that can be used to assess the hydrological output of the catchment at the specific location where the water exits the basin, for instance, the amount of water available for electricity generation in a run-of-river plant."

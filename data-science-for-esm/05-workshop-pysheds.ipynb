It aggregates the number of cells flowing into each downslope cell, *accumulating* the flow as it moves through the drainage network. Hence, as you move downstream, the number increases, and the other way around for upstream. This means that cells with high accumulation values are typically located in valleys or channels where water converges from larger areas, while cells with low accumulation values are often found on ridges or higher elevations where less water flows in."

This ‘system-scale planning’ (SSP) approach provides a large-scale perspective which considers the complex interactions and cumulative effects of different dam combinations rather than determining the impacts of each dam project individually. This type of holistic assessment takes the regional and downstream effects of the entire hydropower scenario into account and allows for strategic planning by comparing various national or international development options. It is particularly useful during the early phases of hydropower portfolio design and can facilitate the dialog between stakeholders and policymakers as a decision support tool.\n",

By integrating surface runoff data over the entire catchment area, typically given in volume per area per time (e.g. millimetres per day), and summing it up for all the cells within the catchment, you can approximate the total water volume contributing to the flow at the pour point. This integration accounts for spatial variations in runoff generation across the catchment, providing you with an aggregated flow estimate that can be used to assess the hydrological output of the catchment at the specific location where the water exits the basin, for instance, the amount of water available for electricity generation in a run-of-river plant."

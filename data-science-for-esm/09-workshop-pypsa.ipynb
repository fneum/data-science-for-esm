    "PyPSA stands for **Python for Power System Analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPSA is an open source Python package for simulating and optimising modern energy systems that include features such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- conventional generators with unit commitment (ramp-up, ramp-down, start-up, shut-down),\n",
    "- time-varying wind and solar generation,\n",
    "- energy storage with efficiency losses and inflow/spillage for hydroelectricity\n",
    "- coupling to other energy sectors (electricity, transport, heat, industry),\n",
    "- conversion between energy carriers (e.g. electricity to hydrogen),\n",
    "- transmission networks (AC, DC, other fuels)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPSA can be used for a variety of problem types (e.g. electricity market modelling, long-term investment planning, transmission network expansion planning), and is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to building power system by hand in `linopy`, PyPSA does the following things for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- manage data inputs in standardised format\n",
    "- build standardised optimisation problem\n",
    "- communicate with the solver(s)\n",
    "- retrieve and process optimisation results\n",
    "- manage data outputs in standardised format\n",
    "\n",
    "The [documentation](https://docs.pypsa.org/) describes it as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "> PyPSA is an open-source Python framework for optimising and simulating modern power and energy systems that include features such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind and solar generation, hydro-electricity, inter-temporal storage, coupling to other energy sectors, elastic demands, and linearised power flow with loss approximations in DC and AC networks. PyPSA is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series. It is made for researchers, planners and utilities with basic coding aptitude who need a fast, easy-to-use and transparent tool for power and energy system analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas` for storing data about network components and time series\n",
    "- `numpy` and `scipy` for linear algebra and sparse matrix calculations\n",
    "- `matplotlib` and `cartopy` for plotting on a map\n",
    "- `networkx` for network calculations\n",
    "- `linopy` for handling optimisation problems"

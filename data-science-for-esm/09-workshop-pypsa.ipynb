    "\n",
    "PyPSA is an open source Python package for simulating and optimising modern energy systems that include features such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- conventional generators with unit commitment (ramp-up, ramp-down, start-up, shut-down),\n",
    "- time-varying wind and solar generation,\n",
    "- energy storage with efficiency losses and inflow/spillage for hydroelectricity\n",
    "- coupling to other energy sectors (electricity, transport, heat, industry),\n",
    "- conversion between energy carriers (e.g. electricity to hydrogen),\n",
    "- transmission networks (AC, DC, other fuels)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPSA can be used for a variety of problem types (e.g. electricity market modelling, long-term investment planning, transmission network expansion planning), and is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.\n",

    "- manage data inputs\n",

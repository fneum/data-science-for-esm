## Create a new fork
<!-- ------------------ -->
<!-- > **Note:** The first step is forking the repository, having the below in mind.

Before forking this repository please have the following in mind: -->
* In the <strong><b><mark>Create a new fork</mark></b></strong> pop-up menu, shown in the figure below, <ins>>deselect</ins> the default **Copy the `main` branch only** option. 
    
By doing so, you will reduce further branch creation, required by the workflow.

> **Note:** The key point is to have/keep the `stanford` branch in your fork. This is fully tested using the `stanford` branch

In this workflow:
* Your source code is in the `stanford` branch
* Your published website is in the `gh-pages` branch

* Alternatively, the `stanford` branch can be created locally: 
~~~
git switch -c stanford
git push origin stanford
~~~

* However, this is to be skipped if adhering to the **Note** above.
* `gh-pages` branch will be automatically generated, as defined by the workflow, hence its creation is not required.
* It is also **not** required to have the `gh-pages` locally, once generated, as it hosts only the static site build files, which are taken care of by the workflow.

> **Note:** The remote `gh-pages`, itself, hosts the required `HTML`, `css`, `.js`, and the other files, used for generating the `github.io` website. Hence, there is no requirement for having the branch locally.

These will be re-generated, upon a successful workflow execution, every time `git push` is performed, in the prior specified git branch. Branch specification is provided [below](#deployment-setup).

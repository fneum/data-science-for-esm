Create a New Fork
==================
<!-- > **Note:** The first step is forking the repository, having the below in mind.

Before forking this repository please have the following in mind: -->
Create your fork of this repository by clicking on the figure below.

In the <strong><b><mark>Create a new fork</mark></b></strong> pop-up menu, shown in the figure below, *<ins>deselect</ins>* the default **Copy the `main` branch only** option. 
    
By doing so, you will reduce further branch creation, required by the workflow.

> **Note:** The key point is to have at least one branch, beside the `gh-pages`, in your fork. This has been tested using both the `main`, as well as the `side branches`.

In this workflow:
* the published website static site content (`jupyter-book build` output) is in the `gh-pages` branch,
* the source code (i.e. Jupyter Book input) is in a arbitrary `branch` defined by the user - any other than `gh-pages`,

The arbitrary `branch` can be created locally: 
~~~
git switch -c content_branch
git push origin content_branch
~~~

<!-- * However, this is to be skipped if adhering to the **Note** above. -->
* `gh-pages` branch will be automatically generated, as defined by the workflow, hence its creation is not required.
* It is **not** required to have the `gh-pages` locally, once generated by the workflow, as it hosts only the static site build files, which are taken care of by the workflow.

> **Note:** The remote `gh-pages`, itself, hosts the required `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and the other files, used for generating the `https://github.com/<user>/data-science-for-esm` website. There is no requirement of having this branch locally.

These will be re-generated, upon a successful workflow execution, every time `git push` is performed, in the prior specified git branch. Branch specification is provided in the [Deployment Settings](./05_Deploy.md#deployment-settings).

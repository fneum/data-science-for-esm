GitHub Pages Setup
==================

In the created forked repository, there is a single setting which needs modifying:

* In the your own forked repository `"owner"/data-science-for-energy-system-modelling`, go to the GitHub **Settings** -> **Pages**.

* In the **GitHub Pages**, go to the **Branch** section, and change the selection from `None` to `gh-pages` `/root`.

Once the branch has been selected, at the top the page a URL will be provided (<ins>give it a a couple of minutes</ins>): **Your site is live at [https://*owner*.github.io/data-science-for-esm](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm/intro.html)**

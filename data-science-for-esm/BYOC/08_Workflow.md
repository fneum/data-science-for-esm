GitHub Workflow Deployment
=========================================================
In [Deployment Settings](./05_Deploy.md#deployment-settings) we defined the deployment branch in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` [file][deploy], which is used by the workflow, whenever performing `git push`.

You are free to use any branch, other than the `gh-pages`, keeping in mind that only upon the `git push`, the workflow will be triggered.

The workflow deployment itself is tracked by your repository's status indicator, in this case a beige-brown dot &nbsp;<strong><b><font color='peru'>‚è∫</font></strong></b>
* _Clicking on it will show the running status, and the deployment details_.

As mentioned, the deployment takes minutes to finish, depending on the content files, i.e. the python commands in the Jupyter Notebooks, which will take the most of time required for the deployment.

Upon the deployment finalization, the status indicator turns to:
* _successful_: a green thick <strong><b><font color='green'>üó∏</font></strong></b>
    * you should be able to see the changes taking place, after some moments, at the specified `https://<user>.github.io/data-science-for-esm`[^1]
* _unsuccessful_: a red cross mark <font color="red">üó∂</font>
    * indicating an error in the `_toc.yml`, or one of the content files, which need to be revisited.

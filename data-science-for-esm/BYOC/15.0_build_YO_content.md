Introduction
=========================================================
<!-- ###### List of Abbreviation[^bignote] -->


This section helps academics, and alike, in building their own content, by modifying this repository. This repository is used as ane example in the figures below.

> **Goal:** *To create a course page for your own knowledge dissemination, like this one, follow this guide.*

* Its primary purpose is to guide you on how to generate a GitHub page, to be used for learning material, i.e. lectures, or similar.
* It can also be purpose for anything else, for that matter.
* This setup draws from the [peaceiris actions-gh-pages][gh_actions], in specific using the [Static Site Generator with Python][SSGwP].
    * *This serves only as a reference, as the the full explanation is below.*

By following these instructions, one is able to create his own website, alike this one, with a tailor-made content, quickly and with ease. Albeit, there are two or three things to keep in mind when doing so. Please read on.


Requirements
-------------
Have in mind that that for a successful workflow run, the [correct python environment][12], with all the [python package dependencies][13] satisfied, is required. Our suggestion is the package manager `conda` or `mamba`, for which further details, and installation instructions, are provided in the [documentation of PyPSA-Earth creators][15].

* Please also keep in mind that there is no need for the usual:

~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

since the

~~~
mamba env create -f envs/environment.yaml
~~~

takes care of both the correct `venv` creation, and packages installation. The only package requiring `pip` is the `highspy` solver. We highly recommend using `highspy`, and for that `pip` is needed:
~~~
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip install highspy
~~~

Python and `*.ipynb` are optimally used in an [IDE](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Our recommendation is VSCode, used by the [PyPSA developers][15], due to its ease of use, and being open-source.

GitHub Pages Setup
=================================================
* In the your own forked repository `"owner"/data-science-for-energy-system-modelling`, please go to the GitHub **Settings** -> **Pages**.

* In the **GitHub Pages**, go to the **Branch** section, and change the selection from `None` to `gh-pages` `/root`.

Once the branch has been selected, a URL will be provided (<ins>give it a minute</ins>), at the top: **Your site is live at [https://"owner".github.io/data-science-for-esm](https://open-energy-transition.github.io/data-science-for-esm/)**

Deployment Setup
===============================================
> **Note:** The key point is to set the correct deployment branch in the <code>./github/workflows/deploy.yml</code>.

In the <code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code> [file][deploy] please specify the branch, later to be used by the workflow. Upon the `git push` command to the specified branch, the workflow will be triggered:

~~~
    push:
      branches:
      - stanford
~~~

The specified `branch` can be any[^1], other than the <ins>`gh-pages`</ins>.

This setup uses the `stanford` branch for our workflow, but it can also be the `main`, or any other newly created branch. Upon the `git push`, the [workflow](#github-workflow-deployment) will be triggered.

The deployment itself is the `jupyter-build book data-science-for-esm/` [command](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/data-science-for-esm/blob/b1ab15c6d99fb325ca3877b0d33578a42669c3b7/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L37). This command is generating the HTML code from the data provided in the data-science-for-esm [folder][16].

Further explanation of this command, i.e. `jupyter-book build`, as well as the other commands is provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/data-science-for-esm/blob/37c3ef84651a12ee947573dfedd6c4b7786731bc/README.md) file. A more detailed explanation is to be found at the following **References:**
1. [Build your book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html)
1. [Build from the command line](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/build.html)
1. [Structure the Table of Contents](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html)

Content Modification Setup
=========================================================
Please use the provided files as templates, as this will assist you in content creating, reducing the time in searching for the answers.

> **Note:** `jupyter-book build` builds content from the *markdown* and jupyter notebook files, hence their content needs modifying.

* The website logo, as well as the other figures can be placed in the `data-science-for-esm/_images/` folder.
* Please keep in mind that, when changing images and modifying files, the referencing throughout `.md` and `.ipynb` files needs changing as well.
* The `.ipynb` and `.md` content files are to be located in the root of the `data-science-for--esm` folder, and specified in the `_toc.yml`.
    * If not being placed in the root, the workflow will be unable to find the files specified in the `_toc.yml`, resulting in the unsuccessful deployment, and unaccessible `github.io`.
* Please modify `*.ipynb` and `.md` files as seen fit. They are the core-content.
* Upon each content update, there is a chain of git to-do commands, resulting in the website update:
~~~
git clone
# make changes to the content
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'new changes applied'
git push origin stanford
~~~

Both `_config.yml`, as well as the `_toc.yml` are to remain in the root of the `data-science-for esm` folder. The details of the website, such as the author, logo, other relevant GitHub and Google Collab links, are defined in the `_config.yml`. Please use the already provided `_toc` and `_config.yml` files as a template, and follow their structure.

* In the `data-science-for-esm/_toc.yml` [file](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/data-science-for-esm/blob/37c3ef84651a12ee947573dfedd6c4b7786731bc/data-science-for-esm/_toc.yml), a sequence of files to be included in the GitHub Page is defined, and further used by the `jupyter-build book` command.

After a successful run, the TOC displayed in the menu, located on the left side of the page.

GitHub Workflow Deployment
=========================================================
In [Deployment Setup](#deployment-setup) we defined the deployment branch in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` [file][deploy], which is used then used for the deployment, whenever performing `git push`. You are free to use any branch, other than the `gh-pages`, keeping in mind that only upon the `git push`, the workflow will be triggered.

The workflow deployment itself is tracked by the status indicator in the repository, in this case a beige-brown dot <strong><b><font color='peru'>⏺</font></strong></b>, which if clicked on, will show the running status, and the deployment details. As mentioned, the deployment takes approx. 2 minutes to finish.

Upon a successful deployment, indicated by the deploy status:
* successful: a green thick <strong><b><font color='green'>🗸</font></strong></b>
* unsuccessful: a red cross mark <font color="red">🗶</font>,
you should be able to see the changes taking place in the specified `github.io` URL.
